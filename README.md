# ShootyThingy
A Unity game demo for my Game Develop optional course at TechX.

## Disclaimer
All code pieces in this repo can be used by TechX students for anything, although the majority of models/textures are downloaded off Unity's assets store (some with minor modifications). Make sure to view the license of such models/textures before using them into your project.

## But david wtf is wrong with your coding style?
I umm... can't really stand C#'s coding style, so I adhered to Java's convention.
