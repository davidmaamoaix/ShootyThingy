# ShootyThingy
A Unity game demo for my Game Development optional course at TechX.

## Disclaimer
All code pieces in this repo can be used by TechX students for anything, although the majority of models/textures are downloaded off Unity's assets store (some with minor modifications). Make sure to view the license of such models/textures before implementing them in your project.

I umm... can't really stand C#'s coding style, so I adhered to Java's style.
